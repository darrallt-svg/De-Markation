# Criteria Grouping Models

This folder stores optional criteria grouping frameworks.

No model in this folder is mandatory.
Any school, department, or teacher can use their own model instead.

## Included model
- `CAPRI.json`

CAPRI mnemonic:
- C = Communication and Collaboration
- A = Attitudes and Values
- P = Practical and Organisational Skills
- R = Research and Critical Thinking
- I = Innovation and Creativity

## How to use a model

To use CAPRI in the app:

```bash
cp 'Criteria Grouping Models/CAPRI.json' config/criteria.json
```

Then restart the app.
